# Maze Solver Visualizer

This project is a maze-solving visualizer that demonstrates the Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms using HTML, Canvas, and JavaScript. The visualizer allows users to see how these algorithms explore the maze to find the shortest path from the start point ('S') to the end point ('E').

## Demo

Check out a live demo of the project [here](https://rohithachar.github.io/dfs_bfs_visualiser/).

## Features

- Visualizes the pathfinding process of DFS and BFS algorithms.
- Interactive maze where you can see the algorithm's step-by-step exploration.
- Configurable maze size and complexity.
- Adjustable speed for visualization.

## Installation

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:RohithAchar/dfs_bfs_visualiser.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd maze-solver-visualizer
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Use the controls to generate a maze.
3. Select either DFS or BFS algorithm.
4. Click on the "Start" button to begin the visualization.
5. Watch as the algorithm explores the maze and finds the path from the start to the end point.
